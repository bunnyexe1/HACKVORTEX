## 🚀 Project Overview

This app tackles the multi-billion dollar issue of counterfeit luxury goods using blockchain technology. It empowers **brands**, **retailers**, and **consumers** to **register**, **verify**, and **transfer ownership** of authentic high-value products with security and ease.

## 🧐 What Problem Does It Solve?

- **Counterfeit Crisis**: Over $500B is lost globally due to counterfeit luxury goods.
- **Weak Traditional Methods**: Holograms, serial numbers, and certificates are easy to fake.
- **Risky Resale Markets**: Lack of trust discourages resale and damages brand reputation.

## 💡 Our Blockchain-Powered Solution

- **🔗 Blockchain Registration**: Every luxury item is registered at the point of sale, creating a **tamper-proof digital certificate**.
- **📱 Instant Verification**: QR code or NFC tags link to the blockchain to confirm authenticity in seconds.
- **🔄 Ownership Transfer**: Transfer ownership seamlessly via blockchain—no third-party verifiers needed.
- **🤝 Brand & Community Integration**: Enable brand-backed limited editions, and let users showcase collections.
